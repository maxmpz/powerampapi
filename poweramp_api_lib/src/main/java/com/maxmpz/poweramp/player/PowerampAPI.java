/**
 * Poweramp Intent based API.
 * <br><br>
 * 
 * Most API intents defined here can be sent to various targets:
 * <ul>
 * <li>broadcast receiver via Context.sendBroadcast to {@link #API_RECEIVER_NAME}
 * <li>redirecting activity via Context.startActivity to {@link #API_ACTIVITY_NAME}<br>
 *     This activity immediately closes itself and it's useful if activity target is required or Poweramp app should be brought to foreground
 * <li>Player service via Context.startService to {@link #PLAYER_SERVICE_NAME}<br>
 *     Not recommended as services are subject to background execution limitation and your code may fail with "app is in background" exception<br>
 *     NOTE: Poweramp doesn't use Context.startForegroundService and if you call Poweramp service with startForegroundService app will crash
 * <li>ScanDispatcher service via Context.startService with {@link Scanner#ACTION_SCAN_DIRS}, {@link Scanner#ACTION_SCAN_TAGS} actions<br>
 *     Not recommended as services are subject to background execution limitation and your code may fail with "app is in background" exception<br>
 * </ul>
 * <br>
 * NOTE: in addition to ACTION_* intent actions defined by PowerampAPI, Poweramp also supports standard intents (these should be sent to {@link #ACTIVITY_STARTUP}):
 * <ul>
 * <li>android.content.Intent.ACTION_VIEW (android.intent.action.VIEW")
 * <li>android.provider.MediaStore.INTENT_ACTION_MEDIA_PLAY_FROM_SEARCH (android.media.action.MEDIA_PLAY_FROM_SEARCH)
 * <li>android.content.Intent.ACTION_SEARCH (android.intent.action.SEARCH)
 * <li>android.intent.action.MEDIA_SEARCH
 * </ul>
 * 
 * Starting from build 853 Poweramp also supports android.provider.MediaStore.INTENT_ACTION_MEDIA_PLAY_FROM_SEARCH (android.media.action.MEDIA_PLAY_FROM_SEARCH) as 
 * broadcast intent for {@link #API_RECEIVER_NAME} (recommended), or PlayerService intent {@link #PLAYER_SERVICE_NAME},
 * so this can be sent directly to service without activity / Poweramp UI starting.<br>
 * NOTE: this is supported for {@link #ACTIVITY_STARTUP} from around build 800<br><br>
 * 2
 * INTENT_ACTION_MEDIA_PLAY_FROM_SEARCH supports:<br>
 * - <b>simple freeform query via SearchManager.QUERY (query) extra</b><br>
 *   - Poweramp will attempt to play track matching query<br>
 *   - Poweramp also looks to keywords such as playlist, album, artist, genre in the query in the local language and if found, Poweramp will attempt to play the found category<br><br>
 *   
 * - <b>focused query via MediaStore.EXTRA_MEDIA_FOCUS query (https://developer.android.com/reference/android/provider/MediaStore#EXTRA_MEDIA_FOCUS):</b><br>
 *   - when EXTRA_MEDIA_FOCUS == MediaStore.Audio.GenresGenres.ENTRY_CONTENT_TYPE (vnd.android.cursor.item/genre):<br>
 *   &nbsp;&nbsp;-> Poweramp plays genre indicated by MediaStore.EXTRA_MEDIA_GENRE (android.intent.extra.genre) extra<br>
 *   - when EXTRA_MEDIA_FOCUS == MediaStore.Audio.Artists.ENTRY_CONTENT_TYPE (vnd.android.cursor.item/artist):<br>
 *   &nbsp;&nbsp;-> Poweramp plays artist indicated by MediaStore.EXTRA_MEDIA_ARTIST (android.intent.extra.artist) extra <br>
 *   - when EXTRA_MEDIA_FOCUS == MediaStore.Audio.Albums.ENTRY_CONTENT_TYPE (vnd.android.cursor.item/album):<br>
 *   &nbsp;&nbsp;-> Poweramp plays album indicated by MediaStore.EXTRA_MEDIA_ALBUM (android.intent.extra.album) and MediaStore.EXTRA_MEDIA_ARTIST (android.intent.extra.artist) extras<br>
 *   - when EXTRA_MEDIA_FOCUS == MediaStore.Audio.Media.ENTRY_CONTENT_TYPE (vnd.android.cursor.item/audio):<br>
 *   &nbsp;&nbsp;-> Poweramp plays song indicated by MediaStore.EXTRA_MEDIA_TITLE (android.intent.extra.title), MediaStore.EXTRA_MEDIA_ALBUM (android.intent.extra.album), and MediaStore.EXTRA_MEDIA_ARTIST (android.intent.extra.artist) extras<br>
 *   - when EXTRA_MEDIA_FOCUS == MediaStore.Audio.Playlists.ENTRY_CONTENT_TYPE (vnd.android.cursor.item/playlist):<br>
 *   &nbsp;&nbsp;-> Poweramp plays playlist indicated by MediaStore.EXTRA_MEDIA_PLAYLIST (android.intent.extra.playlist) extra<br>
 *   - when EXTRA_MEDIA_FOCUS is anything else:<br>
 *   &nbsp;&nbsp;-> Poweramp tries to search for SearchManager.QUERY or MediaStore.EXTRA_MEDIA_TITLE in tracks, genres, and playlists and play the found result<br><br>
 *

		 * NOTE: Poweramp will always do ACTION_SCAN_TAGS automatically after ACTION_SCAN_DIRS is finished and some changes are required to song tags in DB.<br>
