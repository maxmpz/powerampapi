	<!--
	 FastTextView is TextView/Button/ImageButton replacement, which is designed for layout and drawing performance.
	 It's used for a static text, labels, text with icons, and just icons (+ few derived classes including "fast" checkboxes)

	 This is, in some parts, very limited widget, esp. compared to full blown TextView, but it's fast:
	 - it doesn't use Android text layout code
	 - it doesn't support Spanned text
	 - it doesn't support RTL
	 - it has limited drawable support (just one drawable. Can be positioned to the left, right or top)

	 Nevertheless, additional features are:
	 - support for line drawables (per line text background, independent from general view background)
	 - support for additional animatable SceneParams parameters: text color, max lines, drawable, line background, background

	 Paddings:
	 NOTE: fast text padding processing (with drawable) differs from the standard Android TextView.
	 This is due to the requirement for consinstent padding around text, while padding around drawable may be specific to that drawable.
	 This allows same styles for buttons with or without drawables and consinstent text paddings as a result

	 Horizontal FastTextView paddings when no drawable:
	   paddingLeft text paddingRight

	 Horizontal FastTextView paddings when drawable is available, drawablePosition=left:
	   drawablePaddingStart drawable drawablePadding (drawablePaddingEndNoText) paddingLeft text paddingRight

	 Horizontal FastTextView paddings when drawable is available, drawablePosition=right:
	   paddingLeft text paddingRight drawablePadding (drawablePaddingEndNoText) drawable drawablePaddingStart

	 Horizontal FastTextView paddings when drawable is available and drawableOnly=true:
	   drawablePaddingStart drawable drawablePadding paddingLeft paddingRight

	 NOTE: leadingOffset may be added (or removed if negatove) to the paddingLeft/paddingRight (depending on the
	 text gravity).
	 This is special offset which reduces leading pixels difference between various fonts/font styles/font sizes/scaling.
	 Used for the better alignment of the visible text pixels

	 NOTE: drawablePaddingEndNoText is applied only if text is empty (null or "")
	 NOTE: when drawablePosition=GRAVITY (this is default for drawableOnly), no paddings applied as fixed size is assumed

	 Same approach is used for vertical paddings (drawblePosition=top)

	 Paddings with drawablePosition=forceGravity and drawableOnly=true (icon only) are standard paddingLeft/Top/Right/Bottom.
	 drawablePadding/drawablePaddingStart are ignored, as gravity make drawable to be positioned everywhere depending on gravity, thus
	 text-related drawable paddings make no sense in this mode

	 NOTE: generally, some drawables, like <inset> or other drawables with padding can override view paddings completely, when set for FastText/FastButton
	 AFTER initial XML parsing (e.g. during scene animation with the new background)
	 Fast text mitigates this by forcing the initial XML paddings when background is updated for scene

		     This may cause FastTextViews not being the same widths due to line background being attached to the
