	<!-- FastLayout (and variants, like SceneFastLayout) is strictly one-pass, one-measure per pass (thus, fast), supporting multiple
	 layout paradigms within single layout, allowing major child layout manipulation with styles without editing actual layout xmls.
	 Most of the design decisions for FastLayout and its FastLayoutParams are dictated by performance. The resulting layouts
	 are faster vs Android basic layouts (LinearLayout/RelativeLayout), much faster than ConstraintLayout, and can be also used
	 as direct replacement even for very simple layouts as FrameLayout due to the minimal overhead

	 FastLayout can replace:
	 - FrameLayout (not slower than FrameLayout, or faster, as FastLayout never re-meassures children for MATCH_PARENT)
	 - LinearLayout (can be implemented via layout_flex* or most commonly via layout_consumeSpace)
	 - RelativeLayout (FastLayout is faster as it uses strictly one-pass, one measure per pass approach)
	 - partially ConstraintLayout (FastLayout is much faster)
	 - or combination of those in the one layout

	 Mostly every layout you're seeing in Poweramp main UI is FastLayout

	 FastLayout is focused on performance and thus has limitations due to the strict "no-remeasure" approach:
	 - views are laid out in xml order (some layout params may override the layout direction)
	   - if some view is referenced by other view that triggers immediate laying out of such referenced view
		 - if this causes cycle StackOverflowException is thrown

	 FastLayoutLP are attribures for FastLayout child views. FastLayout itself has no extra attributes
